## Files
* Vehicle Detection.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with the code.
* writeup.md - description of vehicle detection and tracking pipeline.
* examples - folder of images used to illustrate the pipeline
* output_videos - folder of test videos with detected objects, created by the code in Vehicle Detection.ipynb.

## Usage
After setting up the environment, open Vehicle Detection.ipynb in Jupyter notebook and run all the cells.
